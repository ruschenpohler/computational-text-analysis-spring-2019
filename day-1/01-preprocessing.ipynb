Again, there are many different [alternatives](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/tree/develop/nltk/tag), but NLTK keeps its recommended POS tagger available through the function `pos_tag`. The tagger expects a list of tokens as input.When doing POS tagging, it is advisable **not** to remove stop words beforehand (although you are free to do it afterwards)."

There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey.\",\n",

What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br />  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes.

Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I\\'d found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I\\'d eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration.

I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really don\\'t think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it\\'s own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.

Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...<br /><br />Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.

For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.

       "  'This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something \"strawberry\" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively \"healthy\" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I\\'ve also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it\\'s still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You\\'ll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.',\n",

       "  \"we have fed our cats a lot of stuff. These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters. They loved the Purina. They loved the Nutro. They loved the Iams. They love whatever we feed them.<br /><br />This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love. After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change. Some made the litter super-stink.  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didn't have to chew it to swallow it...<br /><br />This Felidae has done the trick. No problems to speak of. It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose. The cats love it. The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing. And here's the kicker:<br />After feeding the cats Felidae, their demeanor improved. Their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food. We're now loyal Felidae consumers.<br /><br />Additionally, the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies.\",\n",
       "  \"I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it. She's an older cat, somewhat overweight, and had a grouchy temperament. I first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which -- she ate the Felidae and left the old food! She's now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now, off the old food entirely, and she is a much sweeter, happier cat. I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested, or something. In any case, I am a happy purchaser of Felidae. I don't agree with the previous reviewer that cats don't like it. Clearly, mine does.\",\n",

The other two are arthritic and skinny.<br /><br />Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs, I figured that we\\'d give it a try for our cats.  I\\'d had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems.<br /><br />Buster, the youngest, is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats.  However, the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really \"feeling better\" since we changed their food to Felidae.  Even Prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on Purina One, all she wanted to do was to sleep.<br /><br />I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, it\\'ll be more effective.<br /><br />However, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life.',\n",

       "  'As with canidae, Felidae has also changed their formula.  Cats do not like change when it comes to their food.  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)<br /><br />Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get \"upset\" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.<br /><br />We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn\\'t until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven\\'t suffered one bit like our dogs have.<br /><br />Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.<br /><br />I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible!',\n",

I've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasn't as spicy as this mix is.<br /><br />If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind. To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it. You take a plastic bag, a couple of tbs of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup water and mix the seasoning, water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes. In the meantime, it says to stir fry your veggies (peppers and onion) but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I don't think it affected quality or taste.

FAIL! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers. Not ecofriendly at all.<br /><br />Would I buy these again? No - I feel ripped off. The other crackers (like Sesame Tarragon) give you a little<br />more bang for your buck and have more flavor.',\n",

Less waste results from the high quality ingredients.  I have been hunting, training, showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years, with multiple National Champions.

This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.<br /><br />Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.<br /><br />When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.<br /><br />Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better.\",\n",

If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br /><br />Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours.

The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar. (My recent bad-purchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a \"51A\").

Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. There was a small amount (perhaps an ounce or so) of very small/minced-size/dust-like pieces. Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted!<br /><br />The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.<br /><br />I'm quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally, I find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor, I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom-infused water.<br /><br />This was the first time I used the Roland brand (got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse), and would certainly buy them again.

Naturally, they also go down great with beer.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I\\'m proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven\\'t experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don\\'t have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend these other Kettle Chips flavors: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA\">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM\">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, \"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.\"',\n",
       "  \"These chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school. They are by far the tastiest chips I've had and it's impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag!\",\n",
       "  \"These are by far my favorite chips, they are extremely crunchy (similar to other Kettle style chips), but it's the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks.  I've tried several other brands of Salt and Vinegar and none of them come close.\",\n",
       "  \"They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut. I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture. All around this brand is much better than Frito-Lay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping.

The best thing was that there were a lot of \"brown\" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven\\'t eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag.',\n",

Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again.',\n",
       "  'I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring? Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat.',\n",
       "  'I agree with the other review, these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums. The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt/vinegar combo.

The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great.\",\n",

They have that hot-with-a-hint-of-sweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of Thai food.\",\n",
       "  \"Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.\",\n",

These are thickly cut plain slice potatoes. They are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth. They also have a great taste.

So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them.

I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn\\'t beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn\\'t that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I\\'m getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.

OK, so they're still a snack food, but no salt and no trans-fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get. And if you're on a low-salt diet (like I am), having these available means I can eat chips, and Kettle are just the best.\",\n",

Kettle has lots of flavors but I always go back to these regular lightly salted.<br /><br />They are thicker and sometimes greasy at the bottom of the bag, plus they often looked burned.

       "  'I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  \"What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes \"cheaper\". I don\\'t know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.\"  I did receive a reply: \"Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the \"best before\" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.\"  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the \"bad\" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...',\n",

They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it\\'s deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we\\'re all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of \"United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers\"....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the \"Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum\"! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a \"Potato Chip Diet\".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I\\'d like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I\\'ve taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn\\'t like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!',\n",

They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.

You won\\'t regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren\\'t.  From their website: \"Take a quick look and you\\'ll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag\"<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: \"At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are \"trans fat free\" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.\"  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.

I guess without advertising, it just never found a home.<br /><br />I prefer the plastic bottles, but the ideal size is the 16.9 oz (500 ml) or the one liter.  The problem with the two liter size is that it takes one person (me) too long to drink it, letting it go flat.<br /><br />In any case, Vernor's is unique in that it is aged in oak for three years, I think.  That imparts a great, unique flavor.<br /><br />I wish it would catch on again, and become available more widely.<br /><br />(Recently I did see it on sale in Redwood City in California's Bay Area, south of San Francisco.  The next day, it was gone!\",\n",
       "  'I like \"Vernor\\'s\", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor\\'s is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor\\'s is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can\\'t find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor\\'s Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is \"The Vernor\\'s Story: From Gnomes to Now\" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company\\'s marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor\\'s fans.',\n",
       "  \"If you want to find a good flavor substitute for maple syrup, barley malt, or brown rice syrup, this will do nicely. I use Madhava's agave nectar in my baked goods all the time, and am always pleased with the results. At the time I'm writing this, Amazon was out of stock as a vendor. However, when it was in stock, it was priced well for the 2-pack.<br /><br />Other than baking, I've used it to top waffles, pancakes, and in small doses (1/2 teaspoon) added it to oatmeal. A little goes a long way.<br /><br />Using agave nectar: Use 1/3 to 1/2 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener (depending on your taste and the recipe. Recipes with dried fruit need much less), cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F; if there is oil in the recipe, cut it by 1/3 (alternately, use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid -- just don't use too much or your recipe will be dry). Additionally, when baking, make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry. Most bakers might already know this, but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients (unless beaten with butter first).<br /><br />Agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do, so you won't be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy.

And since we were in a time crunch, we didn't have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting, so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it. Horrible experience, bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever. It spread about as easily as chewing gum, stuck to everything it came in contact with, and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it. On top of all this, it didn't even taste good. By the time we were done decorating, we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family. So we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a pre-made cake. Our cake, which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey, was used as a centerpiece. A really ugly centerpiece, that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried.\",\n",

There weren\\'t large chunks of fat or gristle in any of the cans, which I\\'ve experienced plenty with some brands of canned meats. The proportion of liquids to meat was fair too, it\\'s not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either, though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat. None of the meat was seasoned, at all. This is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring. There is a mild \"spam\"-like texture and taste to the meats(but way better than spam any day), almost a brine or something, that\\'s why I heavily seasoned it. Don\\'t plan on frying anything in the fat from these meats, it gave everything a slightly rancid, soury taste...no idea why!

The main value is as a unique gift.<br />  In the Japanese soy sauce world, there are 4 types: regular, mild (usukuchi), for raw fish (sashimi) and light colored.  Bluegrass soy sauce is regular style.  Compared to Kikoman (a good commercial brand that is widely available) Bluegrass starts saltier, is flat in the middle, then ends with a complex & interesting flavor.  Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round, full flavor in the middle.  Doesn't have the complex ending flavors.  For me, the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikoman's full middle flavor is a plus.  I prefere Kikoman, especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct.  But I lived in Japan for many years and am used to the standard Japanese flavor.  I haven't tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor, which is how soy sauce is usually used.<br />  Bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce.

The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.<br /><br />Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.

It also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to either.<br /><br />Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that's quite a few snacks.

       "  'I bought these back in January and never got around to reviewing them. I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out. Just like the description states, its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate. I wouldn\\'t say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess, well, as long as the chocolate doesn\\'t melt. Anyways, in case anyone is wondering, I ordered from a seller named Very asia (amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie=UTF8&isAmazonFulfilled=0&orderID=103-7071944-5595443&marketplaceSeller=1&seller=A3JW437I54SEI1). I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me (maybe it had to be imported) but when it did, it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever. I\\'m definitely considering re-stocking on this in the future if I can\\'t find a local store<br /><br />EDIT: Oct 11, 2012<br /><br />*****Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase*****<br /><br />So I decided to restock after I couldn\\'t fight the craving anymore. Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good (ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime). What I received was not the picture shown on the front page (2 per pack japanese pocky), it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion, the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste, more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth, this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.<br /><br />Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a) not eat everything at once and b) avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I won\\'t be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I won\\'t change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3. The taste isn\\'t \"terrible\" but its definitely not to my liking. If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received.',\n",

       "  'Pocky is just plain fun to eat. I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though I\\'d heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.<br /><br />This is by no means a health food (it\\'s in the same category as a cookie, it\\'s got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, it\\'s junk food. We all know it\\'s supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless you\\'re really prone to binge-eating or can\\'t stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldn\\'t recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.<br /><br />If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They\\'re really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout \\'caramel delights\" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).<br /><br />Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.<br /><br />However, with this crazy hot summer, I\\'d recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall\\'s cooler weather. You might get a sticky, clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather.

In South Florida, Tate\\'s Comics has them in a variety of flavors..and FRESH and NOT MELTED).',\n",

If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25% of the space inside the box.<br /><br />As far as taste goes they are so-so. On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor.

Unfortnately the last few times we have purchased the bars (all varieties) they have been hard as a rock and my daughter won't eat them.  I have tried them myself and thought I might break a tooth. I had them on subscribe and save; which I have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat.  I agree with a previous post. I want to love these bars and I love everything the company stands for (and actually really like their cookies), but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing.  I hope they address the issue and I will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture. A total bummer -  they were better in the past but something changed with the taste, along with their new packaging!!\",\n",

I then compared the ingredients of the new shipment with the older boxes I still had at home. Guess what?! Cheaper ingredients! Next, I taste-tested, and let my 3 year old help. He wouldn't eat the new ones...and I can't blame him. They are oily and bland. I thought Enjoy Life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a good-tasting product. I was wrong. In summary, these are way too expensive to be made with low-quality, unpalatable ingredients.\",\n",

My family prefers the Very Berry Bars because they can eat those when they miss breakfast, need a healthy snack, or my son will take them on his cross country running meets.

It's not so dense that you want to gag after two bites but also not so light that you can eat the whole box (which really isn't that big).<br /><br />I know alot of people complain about the size/packaging and I agree somewhat.  But each bar is an ounce and 120 calories... on par with many other breakfast bars.  I like the Berry flavor the best, it's the closest to real, non FA specialty flavor.

       "  \"For those looking for a more exotic tea drinking experience and who like white Jasmine tea, Numi's Flower Jewel is worth a look. About the size of a gum-ball, these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower. They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea.<br /><br />Decorative does not mean tasteless. As a white tea, the flavor is mild, but rich and soothing. The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea. I have had stronger jasmine teas, but this one is quite balanced and tasty. I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade. The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and don't get bitter if seeped for long periods.<br /><br />I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels. Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart, though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact. Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf. Better packaging might solve this.<br /><br />If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells, or are entertaining and want a conversation piece, then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list.\",\n",

The truth is, is that yes, it has a bit of fruit in it, but its not sweet at all. The fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you don't have to add anything else.

It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini.<br />I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food.

I realized I was the one helping her poo with nursing and then she lost all ability when she went full-formula.  I say switch....',\n",
       "  'We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html)<br /><br />Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, \"Is my child really constipated?\"<br /><br />Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.<br /><br />Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple.<br /><br />So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:<br /><br />  * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased \"motility,\" we say)<br />  * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces<br />  * a combination of the above two factors<br />  * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract<br />  o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease<br />  o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn\\'t allow easy evacuation<br />  o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage<br /><br />Breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.<br /><br />Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers.<br /><br />Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.<br /><br />When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the baby\\'s rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining.<br /><br />  The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.<br /><br />The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesn\\'t do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining.<br />Top<br /><br />Bottle fed infants are \"a whole \\'nother story.\" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new Similac® that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.<br /><br />The young infant\\'s colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.<br /><br />The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don\\'t realise just how much cereal the baby is getting.<br />Top<br /><br />Treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:<br /><br />  * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.<br />  * I use a lot of Karo® corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don\\'t use it properly, get poor results, and don\\'t recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).<br /><br />  Before scolding me about \"the risk of botulism\" from corn syrup, please see:<br /><br />  Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: \"Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember\"<br /><br />  \"In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.\"<br /><br />  For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5.<br /><br />  * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.<br />  * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.<br />  * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won\\'t come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)<br />  * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don\\'t eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalac®, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.)<br /><br />Top<br /><br />Myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:<br /><br />  * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.<br /><br />  The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.<br /><br />  * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. The problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! Unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (Karo®, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.<br /><br />Top',\n",

Here are a few to start:<br /><br />*According to studies, Chia possesses the highest percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids(linolenic and linoleic) of all crops. Chia seeds contain 60% omega 3 fatty acids.<br /><br />*The protein content of Chia is higher that other nutritional grains. Unlike other grains, it is a complete protein, meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids. About 19 to 23% of chia seeds weight is protein.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are high in fiber, a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber. Our body requires at least 35 gm of fiber a day to stay healthy.<br /><br />*Chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are rich in calcium, about 2 oz of chia seeds contains 600 mg of Calcium, as compared to 120 mg for a cup of milk.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 2 times more potassium than banana.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 3 times more antioxidants than blueberries<br /><br />Regardless of the astonishing nutritional values of Chia, it also tastes very good. My girlfriend and I make a big pot of \"steel cut\" oatmeal at night (the quick way is throw a cup of oats in 4 cups of boiling water and just let it sit overnight), put in a good helping of chia powder, and the next morning you have a wonderful breakfast that could last all week depending on how many people are eating it. Feel free to add a little cinnamon, peanut butter, fruit, or your own oatmeal favorite additions.<br /><br />There are many other recipes for eating Chia, but oatmeal is my personal favorite.  I started eating Chia last year after reading the NY Times Bestseller \\'Born to Run\\' about how a tribe of Mexicans that eat Chia will drink beer, smoke tobacco, and then run up to 500 miles in a footrace the following days.  One of the primary contributors to the tribal Mexicans\\' seemingly supernatural physical ability is that their diet is full of the nutrient-rich Chia seeds. I haven\\'t put in 500 miles.  But after previously failing to finish a 26-mile marathon without chia in my diet, I added chia to my diet and my knees allowed me to finish my first 26-mile marathon!  Could the Chia have helped?  I think so.  I certainly had more energy and my joints felt better my second attempt at a marathon when \"on\" the Chia.<br /><br />I started out paying an arm-and-a-leg at Whole Foods for Chia powder, but have since started buying them on Amazon for a fraction of the price.

I\\'ve read people reviews and they said there were small brown pieces that were hard, that means they were not cooked long enough.  The best way to cook these are to use a medium size pan, pour the pack into the pan and shake it around and bake them in the oven @ 400 degrees for 4-6 minutes, keep a close eye on them because they burn easy.  But it is worth it to cook it in the oven, very hot and fresh and no uncooked curls.  They will appear to be brown at first but they \"poof\" up in the oven once they\\'re heated.  I would say do not microwave these in a bag, use a oven safe plate, that way you can actually see them puff up, older/cheap microwaves can take 4-6 minutes to cook.',\n",

I found it to be the opposite with these pork rinds.  I had to cook the port rinds LONGER than the directions say on the package, otherwise they wouldn\\'t be popped nicely and were a bit chewy.

After reading the reviews here, decided to give these a try.<br /><br />I had never had anything other than the bagged variety of pork rinds.  As others have mentioned here, these are far superior to anything you will find in a bag.  Way, way better than any bagged variety I have sampled.  Plus the make this great popping, crackling noise when you take them out for a minute or so that I greatly enjoy for some reason.<br /><br />Do mind the cooking instructions.  If you overcook, they will end up tasting closer to the bagged taste you are trying to avoid.  Still better than bagged though.  I tried different times in my microwave but found it best to watch and take them out as soon as the bag stops rising.

I found that the bag\\'s expansion--or not---has little to do with whether they are done. I have a 1200 watt microwave and 1:30 was perfect. 1:00 and they were not cooked, 2:00 and I had charcoal bits.<br />I had to sacrifice a couple of precious bags to figure this out.<br /><br />Taste and texture? Well they are infinitely better than bags of pork rinds from the store. The texture is very good. The taste? I am in no way shy of salty food, love me some salt! But these were borderline too much for me. I did sprinkle some cinnamon and Ideal on them to make them sweet and I still had a hard time eating them. My husband liked them this way though.<br /><br />If they could back off the strong salty flavor, I would buy these again. As it is, I\\'m going to use them to make low-carb nachos.

       "  'Few things are as enjoyable in life as freshly popped pork rinds.  Modern technology has enabled us to produce the epitome of snack foods in a hot, fresh version.  I will be relegated no more to the listless depths of popped corn.  Pork rinds are the ultimate man chips. Very similar to microwaved popcorn, you just shake the bag and put em in your microwave for about 2 min and voila, hot fresh pork rinds.  When you pop them you have to get accustomed to the fact that they don\\'t \"pop\" like popcorn - they just crackle a bit.  So it is a bit hard to tell when they are done and usually through trial and error you will get the perfect time depending upon the type of microwave oven you use.  Mine is 900W and takes just under 2 min. A couple of pieces will get burnt, or as I affectionately refer to as char. The bag will inflate slightly.  When they are done, you open it up and you are greeted with an aroma that is bacon heaven.  Put one in your mouth right away and it will stick to your tongue like a live octopus.  They are a bit salty so they make the perfect accompaniment to a nice cold beer.  I didn\\'t find them too spicy, just enough.  If you want to be creative, you can throw em in a bowl right after they are done popping and throw some salsa verde or any other kind of salsa you have.  You will be greeted with a chorus of wonderful snaps like getting sizzling rice soup at a Chinese restaurant.  Throw on some shredded cheese and the result is \"man nachos\".  My wife thinks that it is utterly disgusting, even though that hasn\\'t stopped her from eating them.  Trust me, they are delicious, but don\\'t let em sit too long or they get soggy.',\n",

The key to getting the best yield is to shake the bag before cooking. That will distribute the pellets evenly. Then you have to find the \"sweet spot\" for cooking time. Mine is 2 min 30 sec which leaves me with no burnt or uncooked pieces. I only have two minor criticisms: 1) The serving size is a little small and 2)the spice mixture is a tad bit too salty for me.

They expand considerably in the bag during 1:00 to 2:00 of nuking, depending on the wattage, etc., but it is a slow expansion, unlike the vigorous popping of corn.  Also, the bag  only expands about half as much as with popcorn.  When ready, these resemble the ones available in cellophane bags that were deep-fried, but these are far tastier, fresher, AND MUCH LOWER IN FAT AND CALORIES.

In our 1100 watt oven 40-43 seconds seems to be just right.<br /><br />The key is to take them out the moment the bag has fully inflated. Leave them in too long and you end up with charcoal and not enough time will make them gummy.<br /><br />Since I follow a fairly low carb regimen for health and weight reasons, I like the fact that these can be a perfect vehicle for guacamole and salsa without the carbs.

They come out hot and fresh tasting. Pieces are relatively small, about an inch square. They have a less intense pork flavor than the best pork rinds, but having them hot helps compensate. Amazingly, pork rinds are becoming \"diet food.\" They have no carbs, there is a lot of air in them that minimizes the calories for the volume, and relatively small quantities are satisfying.

I had the same issues with some of the others who\\'ve bought them in that finding out how long to microwave them with your particular microwave is a trial and error process on the first bag or two. On my first attempt, they \"fluffed-up\" fine, but I ended up microwaving them too long and some of them started to scorch (leaving a bad burnt smell, though not quite as bad as popcorn when the same thing happens). Spreading them out inside the bag before you start to microwave them is probably the single most important thing you can do. It\\'s a little tricky, but you can get them to move around a bit with minimal effort. If you just throw the bag in the microwave as if it\\'s popcorn, you won\\'t get a quality product, but if you take the time to spread them out (as stated on the bag) and then watch the bag until it stops expanding (again, stated on the bag), they\\'re quite good.<br /><br />Once you get the hang of it, the Bacon Curls are pretty delicious, especially paired with a beer or two (something pale and drinkable, from a \"yard work\" kind of beer to something like an IPA). The curls/rinds are light and fluffy, but very crunchy (surprisingly so, I was halfway expecting there to be some kind of greasy sogginess, but there isn\\'t). They\\'re on the salty side, but again, with the beer, that\\'s a good thing. I like how they come out of the package sizzling and popping a bit, warm (not hot) and delicious.

Bottom line....if you don\\'t have a quality oven, don\\'t buy these. One last word. After you remove the bag from the oven, carefully open, shake, and simply blow on them until they stop crackling.

       "  'These pork skins have a great taste. Very fresh \"homemade\" taste. The cooking procedure can be a bit tricky though. I have a 1000w microwave with a turn table and did not get the same results with each bag. The first bag I tried with 1 minute, and additional 15 second intervls, stopping at 1min, 15 seconds. Several skins had not yet cooked. So I rolled the end of the bag back up and gave it 15 more seconds. Still some did not fully \"explode\" or \"bloom\".  The second bag I started with 1 minute, 30 seconds. Slightly better results, but again I needed to re-roll the end of the bag and give it another 15-30 seconds, still using the 15 second intervals for best results.  The third bag I started with 2 minutes (which is also the amount of time that is used on my popcorn setting) and the results were not as good. Too many had over-cooked and were too hard to eat.<br />My suggestion would be to stick with the 1 minute with 15 second intervals, listening closely to the sound. (They emit a slight hissing sound when they expand).  As soon as the bag has fully opened and the hissing sound subsides, it\\'s a good sign you have reached the optimal result.  This item is a little more work than just picking up a bag of ready to eat at the store, but the improved flavor is worth it. To me anyway.

There\\'s enough salt in them to kill a horse, which in and of itself wouldn\\'t be so bad (I actually like salty things) but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning, it left me hunting for listerine - or gasoline, whatever I could get my hands on - to get the taste out of my mouth.

Two minutes in my microwave (1100 Watts, but 10 years old) is perfect, and virtually all rinds pop every time.<br /><br />This is a low fat product, so it isn\\'t nearly as tasty as the supermarket pork rinds you may have tried.  One could easily eat an entire package, although there are three servings per bag, but you will pay the consequences in terms of salt intake and MSG overload.  The MSG triggered a migraine for me, so now I don\\'t eat it frequently, and make sure I only consume half a bag at most.  When I get near the bottom of the bag, where the most salt and MSG ends up, I try to brush off as much as I can.<br /><br />Still, a good snack option for those with blood sugar sensitivities.

I've had pork rinds from the stores and thought they were pretty good, so I expected this to be at or better than my local convenience store brand.  Wrong.  I was first disappointed with the texture.  After following the instructions to microwave from 1-2 minutes, some (about 1/4) were crispy, but the rest were almost like taffy and would stick to the teeth?  Perhaps I didn't cook long enough, so 2nd bag stayed in longer which made a few more crispy, but more burnt and chewy ones.  But texture is only 1/2 the problem, the biggest issue was that the product taste like the bag. The taste of the microwave bag seems to bake into the product giving them a paper bag taste.  Finally,those without the full paper bag taste didn't really have a lot of flavor.  They were salty (which is to be expected),but that's really all the flavor you get.  So if your desperate and too lazy to get out a store (or can't find any in a near by store), this may work for you.

Now to the bad part, I usually purchase either the Coombs Family Farms or Highland Sugarworks brands of maple syrup and I love their taste; it was a bitter disappointment when I first tasted the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup and realized I'd made a huge mistake.<br /><br />I do not cook with these syrups, I use them for one thing and one thing only -- pancakes, waffles, or French-Toast. The aforementioned brands I usually purchase are awesome on my breakfast products, but the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup had a very funny off-putting taste that made it impossible to enjoy my breakfast. Don't get me wrong, it isn't nasty, but in comparison to Coombs or Highlands it is terrible.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $36 on maple syrup, as I now have about 60 oz. of Hidden Springs Maple Syrup that I won't eat.

When it goes back down I'll renew, but until then it's other places that are cheaper.  These are Fred Meyer in bulk and Trader Joe's ($2.89/box).  The best price is Fred Meyer.<br /><br />Make sure that you chew the cereal good.  The flax seeds are whole.  If they enter the body whole, they EXIT whole as well, and that means you get zero nutrient from them.

It\\'s zesty and peppery and it does taste like cheese.<br /><br />I thought that the 3 tablespoons of oil they say to mix the \"cheez\" sauce with was excessive.  I used one teaspoon of oil and 1/2 cup of the cooking water I reserved from the pasta and let it simmer while stirring for a few minutes to thicken.  Then I added the pasta and green beans that I cooked with the pasta.  It was really tasty!  The macaroni, which was a nice texture and cooked up beautifully, has ridges to hold the sauce.  Do not over cook the pasta though, it needs maybe 8 1/2 or 9 minutes.<br /><br />It\\'s just way too expensive.  I really think Namaste Foods could make money and still price this much better to be affordable for the average person.  No need to price gouge people who have food sensitivities and parents who have children with Celiac Disease.  I know this type of product costs more to produce because of the need for a dedicated facility and the special ingredients but your prices are ridiculous.<br /><br />Most families are on a strict budget especially in these days of poor economy and job losses.

If you\\'re looking for something to replicate annies GF mac and cheese (which DOES contain dairy) then you will search in vain.

This worked great for me, and made it seem much creamier than I had expected from other reviews.  I also kept out a little of the starchy pasta liquid before I drained it to help coat the pasta with the sauce.  Added in some cooked chicken, fresh tomato and parsley.  It was delicious,  I\\'ll definitely do this again!',\n",

       "  'The first time I tried this, I thought it was beyond hideous. I was expecting something that tasted vaguely like pasta with cheese sauce. I had only recently developed a total dairy intolerance on top of the gluten problem, so was having very bad experiences with \"cheez\" & cheese subsitutes. Every one I\\'ve tried has been uniformly hideous, so it\\'s not like I had high hopes for this dish. It is not even remotely cheese-like (or even \"cheez-like\"), and hoping for something that tastes within screaming distance of cheese messes up one\\'s expectations something awful. However, I found if I approach this dish after erasing all thoughts of \\'cheesishness\\' from my mind & tastebuds, it\\'s quite good. Actually describing the taste is a bit of a challenge...it\\'s got tons of flavor, not hot-spicy but turmeric/onion/garlic/paprica/butterish/something... maybe it\\'s the hemp seed that gives it the indescribable yumminess I can\\'t begin to compare with anything I\\'m familiar with. Whatever the heck it is, I find myself madly craving it quite often.<br /><br />As it comes out of the package, it\\'s not creamy at all , though one can up the creaminess by adding whatever milk substitute you prefer, & I\\'ve also added \\'fake cream cheese\\' to it with decent creamy results.<br /><br />Still, I wish they\\'d get rid of the \\'cheeselike\\' claims & call it something else; it seems to me it\\'d better prepare folks for liking it, thus increasing the sales, thus BRINGING DOWN THE PRICE, which is my main complaint with this & all the Namaste foods. I really feel like too often those of us with real, severe, dietary restrictions --who have no choice in a specialty diet as opposed to those who are \"going gluten free\" as a way of jumping on a fad bandwagon-- are being budgetarily scr....er, shafted by specialty food makers.<br /><br />If anyone has been introduced to Cincinnati chili as an adult without adequate prior preparation, the shock experience of this pasta mix is something akin to that. I grew up on Cinci chili & have a lifelong addiction, but if you approach it expecting something like good ole texas chili with meat \\'n\\' tomato \\'n\\' beans, your taste buds are in for one heckuva shock. Those with no preconceived notions frequently love the stuff, but it is very, very different from traditional chili, having been concocted by Greeks.',\n",

White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is certified organic, and is both fair trade and kosher.<br /><br />It is made from hand-wrapped white tea leaves and rosebuds! Rosebuds---can you imagine?!?! Those are the only two ingredients, and they are delicate and delicious, different from anything else I\\'ve ever tried. This Amazon page erroneously lists some other ingredients but these are absolutely NOT in this tea---it is made from only white tea and roses.<br /><br />This tea, like all Numi teas, is packaged with 100% post-consumer waste, and the tea bags are made from biodegradable filter paper. Numi does not believe in the practice of adding oils or flavorings to bolster flavors, and I love this and can tell the difference; for this and many other reasons, Numi is one of my favorite tea manufacturers.<br /><br />On the box, Numi writes: \"Roses have been a symbol of love and beauty since the dawn of romance. Numi\\'s enchanting Velvet Garden(tm) releases a provocative sweet rosy taste as it blushes a soft pink. With every sip this liaison of organic rose petals and delicate Spring White tea imparts a silken smoothness. White Tea is the tender bud of the tea plant making it exquisitely subtle and supremely healthy. High in antioxidants and vitamin C, this uplifting Fair Trade Certified white tea blend will be the beginning of a long lasting love affair.\" I have to agree.

If you are new to Numi but love white tea, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi.

I will be definitly be buying this brand again from Amazon.com as it arrived in excellent condition within 5 days.<br /><br />If you are thinking about trying/buying quinoa, I highly recommend the NOW organic quinoa.',\n",
       "  \"I love quinoa for its delicious taste, texture, and nutritional benefits. This NOW brand as sold on Amazon is a great bargain. I do a lot of research before I purchase items and feel satisfied that this is a good deal. There is no need to soak this quinoa. The bag tells you to rinse it before using, but I never have and we love the taste. Quinoa can be used in a variety of ways, but one of our favorites is to make Quinoa Pilaf, the same way you would make rice pilaf. (Simply chop onions, carrots, and celery and saute in olive oil. Then add the quinoa and substitute chicken broth for the water and cook as per directions.) Quinoa is a great substitute for rice in general. This brand provides consistent results, always cooking evenly.<br /><br />TIP: When I open a bag and use a bit, I store the rest in a glass mason jar to keep it fresh. That way it's easy to scoop out what you need and stores beautifully in the pantry/cabinet.\",\n",
       "  \"I consider myself a fanatical quinoa connoisseur, having enjoyed many varieties over several decades. NOW Foods Organic Quinoa is by far the best quinoa I have ever purchased. First, the quinoa seeds themselves are thoroughly pre-rinsed. There is no acrid flavor whatsoever. There is no impurity in this product. It is 100% quinoa. I do not know what NOW has done differently, but this quinoa cooks more evenly than any other quinoa. I mean, the seeds all cook about the same -- not mushy, not too sticky. It's about 90 cents per lb more than the cheapest quinoa, but remember that it is organic, while the other quinoa is not. I highly recommend this quinoa.\",\n",

Green beans and carrots basically turn to mush in my mouth, and I can barely taste them. Corn isn't mushy, but doesn't taste sweet. I suspect this has something to do with being canned in a tomato base. Alphabet noodles have a nice texture. Smooth, and not too mushy.<br /><br />I love this soup.

       "  'Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she\\'d eat: \"She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years.\"<br /><br />So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she\\'ll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can\\'t resist.<br /><br />We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it\\'s not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she\\'s got to eat. (So you won\\'t worry that we\\'re ignoring her renal problems, she\\'s on daily medication and is doing quite well.)<br /><br />It\\'s not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it.

Because of some health concerns he has been drinking only decaf coffee for well over a year. He recently had problems after having a couple cups of what was supposed to be decaf at a restaurant. We believe regular coffee was brewed in what was supposed to be the decaf pot. At a recent visit to our \"local\" Starbucks, which is 90 miles away, I discovered the VIA decaf Italian Roast and bought a three pack for him to try. He likes strong, good coffee and was impressed after his first cup. He took two packages to a meeting last night so he could have coffee, too, when the rest of the group was having real coffee and drank both of them and came home wishing he had more of the VIA. I\\'ve placed a pre-order for the 50 pack available through Amazon and from now on when we travel, he will be carrying a supply of decaf Italian Roast VIA with him so he will know for sure the coffee he is drinking is decaf. It seems expensive until you look at what you would pay for a cup of mediocre coffee at any restaurant.',\n",

Unfortunately, it has to be a special splurge when my budget allows.\",\n",

The one that stuck with me the most was a polling of 12 year-olds, who gave Skippy peanut butter a resounding recommendation for its tastes and texture. In writing this review, I went back and checked to see what more adult reviewers think. I\\'m taking the liberty of quoting from the CookingLightly website so far as its review of Creamy:<br /><br />\"The roasted peanuts on the ingredient list are evident in the heady aroma and balanced flavor. Testers thought this sample was a touch oily, but spread the best...Makes the perfect peanut butter sandwich, but can turn into a savory dressing when mixed with soy, vinegar, and crushed red pepper to serve over sugar snap peas, broccoli, or a stir-fry. For a sweet version, mix with honey and mayonnaise and use as a fruit salad dressing. Mix with chile paste with garlic (sambal oelek) or sriracha for an easy sauce for roast meats.\"<br /><br />This is my opinion, too, and while the above review was for the regular Creamy, it applies in my opinion to the reduced fat version just as well. I love this peanut butter. I know that Jif and Peter Pan are also often ranked highly, but Skippy is by far my preference.<br /><br />While I use it on sandwiches, I often just eat a tablespoon or two as a quick snack and source of protein. It is so good in this role that I gave it to a diabetic friend. She uses it in lieu of orange juice if she\\'s starting to feel hypoglycemic. The peanut butter stays with her longer and has a smoother effect.<br /><br />I will note that some nutritionists are now raising questions abou he value of reduced fat peanut butter. They have two ASIC points:<br /><br />1. The process of removing fat is n fact removing monounsaturated oils which are healthy for us.<br /><br />2. To compensate for any loss of taste, manufacturers are putting back in sugars and oils which may not e so healthy.<br /><br />My rating is based on taste and texture. I\\'m not taking a position in nutritional debates but do suggest that you check these matters out separately if you are concerned about this kind of issue.',\n",

What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and \"other natural flavors\", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I\\'ve been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond \"Honey Roasted Almonds\" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It\\'s as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it\\'s not the same product.<br /><br />I\\'d contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not \"slivered\" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I\\'m offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned \"Honey Roasted Almonds\" from the same company.

Yeah, there\\'s a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed.

Using a drip coffee maker to brew it keeps it from overheating and getting bitter.  It's healthy, too, with plenty of antioxidants in it's orange/black pekoe blend.

I recommend it without reservation. And isn't Amazon just lovely...?  They'll bring it right to your door.  How much more could you ask?<br /><br />Earlier I mentioned an English teapot.  I favor Sadler's because of the excellent glaze, and the good material they use in the functional brown teapots they make.<br /><br />A good teapot matters.  Get yourself one, a nice tea ball, and some Lipton Loose tea and you will likely never use teabags again.

My only gripe is I would like to see loose tea available in larger packages. Lipton used to sell it in one pound boxes, but now it's only available in 1/2 pound boxes.

Make it sweet or unsweet, it does not matter. If you make it too strong, just add water, the flavor is there!  You will be amazed as to how many GALLONS of tea you can make with one box.  You will need to brew it a few times to figure out your formula. It's worth the time!  I live in an area that has very soft water, so I don't need as much product to brew a gallon. It definitely takes more if you have hard water.<br />This is how I brew mine (this may help you get started). Using a Mr. Coffee,(12 cup) Measure 3 Tablespoons (slightly rounded) and place in the filter (just as you would coffee) Fill you crafte to the max, and brew. For sweet tea, I use One and 1/4 cup sugar per gallon. It's  easier to put the sugar in a gallon pitcher, then add the hot liquid. The sugar will dissolve completely, and you won't need as much sugar. When the sugar has dissolved, add water or ice to bring it up to a gallon.

       "  \"Initially I purchased this in good faith for brewing it as iced tea as it is quite difficult to find loose tea leaves in stores. Here's my initial report and impressions:<br /><br />The tea leaves came loose of course but the packaging is terrible. The bag is not sealed and the flap is just folded so tea leaves came out of the bag while in transport. So a lot of your tea leaves will be inside the box which is not good. I would hope that in the future Lipton chooses a better packaging alternative to seal the bag so you don't have tea leaves all over the place.<br /><br />And as another reviewer mentioned, it is true that this particular brand has little bits and pieces of tea leaves and is not as good quality compared to other brands. And as always, you pay for what you get. I didn't expect this to be better than my Jasmine tea in a tin can which costs about $45 and taste fantastic. My goal was to buy cheap black tea leaves which are loose to make lemon iced tea which I was able to do well with that.<br /><br />Here is my lemon iced tea recipe after a lot of trial and error and taste testing:<br /><br />-1 Gallon of Lemon Iced Tea-<br /><br />1. 1 Gallon of water<br />2. 5-9 Tablespoons of Lipton Black Tea<br />3. Empty teabags<br />4. 1 cup of sugar<br />5. 1/2 cup of lemon juice<br /><br />Lipton's direction call for 2 tablespoons of Lipton Black Tea to make 1 1/2 quarts of black tea to drink. We know that 4 quarts is equal to 1 gallon, if we used 4 tablespoons of black tea we would only end up with 3 quarts of tea which is short of one gallon. If 2 tablespoons makes 1 1/2 quarts then 1 tablespoon would make about .75 of a quart. So you would need at least a minimum of 5 tablespoons or even about 5 1/4 tablespoons of tea leaves to get your 4 gallons. I would not recommend using more than 9 tablespoons as it would make the tea too strong. Some people have said that the tea is too strong for the little amount that you use to brew your tea but I would have to disagree with that. I thought the tea wasn't strong enough.<br /><br />So go ahead and boil your water till you hit the boiling point. Use between 5-9 tablespoons depending on how strong you want your tea to be and fill up those empty teabags. The directions call for brewing your tea for about 3-5 minutes. Being a tea drinker I knew that if I brew it too long that tannins would be released and make the tea bitter (yes! tannins are what make your tea bitter). If your water is too hot or you brew your tea too long the tannins will be released in the leaves making your tea bitter. Initially I only brewed my tea for about 2 minutes because I was scared that the tea would be bitter if I brewed it too long. But I found that 2 minutes time was not enough time and increased my time to about 3 1/2 to 4 minutes. That is enough time to brew the tea without releasing the tannins so Lipton's brewing time was about spot on. After you finish brewing your tea add your 1 cup of sugar and then your lemon juice. I used cane sugar and Hy-Top reconstituted lemon juice but you can use whatever brand you like or you can even use fresh squeezed lemon juice if you want. I did try Real Lemon Juice while at another supermarket but I didn't like it compared to my generic brand of lemon juice by Hy-Top.<br /><br />You probably wanted to know if I actually drank the tea without it being Lemon Iced Tea, and I did. I didn't like it nor would I recommend you drink this tea this way. I just did not feel that this tea was up to quality compared to many other brands. Maybe I've just been spoiled by other brands but I just feel that this tea wasn't up to par against other black teas nor do I recommend drinking it as just plain black tea. I particularly like the English Breakfast Black Tea by Stash better than this tea. I just felt that the quality difference was a lot but I didn't feel like buying every bag for $0.09 each every time I went to the supermarket just to brew Lemon Iced Tea. If you want to make lemon iced tea with the Stash brand you need 9 English Breakfast Black Tea bags and the same amount of sugar, lemon juice, and water.

It never occured to me that it could be the tea.  I have never had a problem like this.  After a week of stomach problems, and tring different solutions I finally stopped drinking the tea.  Immediately my stomach was better.  A few days later I started drinking the Lipton loose tea again and immediately my stomach was upset.  I looked on the internet and a few suggested I add a bit of honey and a bit of salt.  I tried that with no success.  Does anyone else have any ideas?  I hate to throw out six boxes of tea.',\n",

Start with cold, filtered water and a scoop (rounded tablespoon) of loose tea per cup into the paper basket filter. Adjust per taste. If you use a machine where coffee had been brewed, it may affect the taste, so use any new machine and keep it just for tea. This makes wonderful iced tea!<br /><br />Loose tea is a broader cut leaf unlike teabags where the leaf is chopped fine. The flavor is much fuller and crisper, like the difference between fresh ground coffee and instant. No messy teabags to contend with. I like glass mugs, as they let the gorgeous color of the tea show through.<br /><br />Some areas may not stock Lipton loose tea in stores, but buying online turned out to be cheaper. Six half-pound boxes arrived in two days. A box will last me about two weeks, but I drink tea exclusively.

       "  'Lipton Loose Tea, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM6PC6\">Lipton Loose Tea, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, is a reminder of the way things were when I was a little child.  My mother, all her sisters, my grandmother, and all our friends considered Lipton Loose Tea to be TEA. There was no other for them.  I grew up thinking anything else was an \"off\" brand.  (Lipton Tea is America\\'s favorite tea.)<br /><br />In the South most people make it sweet.  They add the sugar while it is hot so less sugar is required.  Now I prefer to use Splenda (SPLENDA No Calorie Sweetener Granular, 9.7-Ounce Resealable Bags (Pack of 2)) and lemon juice. This tea has a strong black-tea taste.  It is robust and pure.<br /><br />When I moved across the Mississippi River, I was shocked to discover that people in Louisiana drink their tea three times as strong as they do in Mississippi. I think one reason my people liked Lipton Loose Tea so much was that we had very little money and we had to make things go as far as possible.  It was always a good bargain.  Almost any kind of tea is an excellent bargain.<br /><br />Nutritonally it is outstanding.  It is a means of hydrating, which is considered important.  (Always hydrate responsibly:  don\\'t drink too much! You would not want to drown.) Also it is an excellent source of flavonoids, which provide antioxidants. A glass of tea has about half as much caffeine as a cup of coffee.  Since the ingredients vary with different practices, it is difficult to estimate the amount of caffeine.<br />Some caffeine can help many people.<br /><br />On my blog, which you can find at Flavored with Love: Mary Lou\\'s Family and Friends Can Cook, I talked about my mother\\'s tea and all the spread she used to make when she took food to church for dinner on the grounds.  The name of the blog entry is \"Myrtle\\'s Stuffed Eggs.\"<br /><br />About stains -- it is helpful to brush and polish your teeth immediately after enjoying this wonderful tea.  Also, you can clean glasses, pitchers, etc., with baking soda. One more tip is to drink with a straw to try to avoid getting so much of the liquid on your front teeth. (I do this, but I don\\'t think it helps much.)<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.',\n",

Very, very seldom do I add sugar.  And when I do, it is a very small amount.  Where I grew up, sugar in tea is an option.  However, I was stationed in the Deep South, and they drink thick sugar water with a drop of tea in it.  When my daughter was in elementary school, her teacher had the audacity to bring me a glass of that thick sugar water; I gagged.  I couldn't get past the first sip.

I nice strong burn for about half an hour and the small endorphin rush that follows is a good pickmeup, but, by no means recommended, I'm abit of an idiot at times and have been told in other scenarios that I have no taste buds.<br /><br />lastly, so far as I can figure one drop of this in 8 fluid ounces of liquid will raise it about 300 scovilles. so I assumed 4 drops in a cup of hot chocolate would give me about half a jalapeno. well, I could hardly taste the chocolate and my stomach threatened to chew it's way out alien style.<br /><br />and I just reminded myself that I got some sauce on my finger nearly 5 hours ago because after all that time and various hand washings my eye still burned after scratching it.<br /><br />sorry if that's a little long, but I wanted to add more input to this highly underrated product.<br /><br />and very lastly. if indeed the dropper releases 50 microliters at a time (the best description of the measurement of a drop I could find) then there are well over a thousand drops in this bottle. though I'm not that great at math, so you don't have to take my word for the numbers I give here.<br /><br />happy eating,<br />  Daniel\",\n",

I started small and thought I was a hot sauce champ so I got cocky and put idk how much on a BBQ sandwich.I got dizzy and confused and was like,\"uh-oh\" lucky my wife wasn\\'t there to see it because she\\'s always lecturing me about spicy food. Around 2 hours later I was pissing razors. I will continue to eat it though,as much as I can stand anyway.',\n",
       "  \"This sauce is most definitely hot.  Not intolerable, but definitely hot, the hottest I own and I have sauces made from the Ghost Pepper. I put a drop about the diameter of a pea on a tortilla chip.  Immediately you have the flavor, which isn't too bad to be honest.  Kind of a dark, smoky, pepper fruit flavor.  Then the heat shows up and keeps building from a tinge until your mouth feels like its glowing.  Maybe its because I wasn't an idiot who took a spoonful of the stuff, but there was no 30 minute burn.  The real burn lasted 5, *maybe* 10 minutes.  The gut bomb that everyone talks about?  Nonexistent.  And I am not one of these people who claim to eat habaneros plain on their own, because I don't.  Personally I have to call BS on the people that say that.  Its a bit expensive for a 2 oz bottle, but when all it takes to give something a pleasant heat is a drop or two without changing flavor, its worth the price.  This sauce will last you for a while.<br /><br />Final thought:  Dont be a hero and try to take a whole spoonful of this.  Not only is it too expensive to use it like that, but take that much and you will regret it.\",\n",
       "  'This is the hottest sauce I have ever had.  Just 1 drop in a soup makes my mouth burn for 30 minutes and I start crying.  This sauce is not for the faint of heart.',\n",
       "  \"Like most other 'sauces' in this heat range, this sauce adds heat to a dish without significantly affecting the flavor.  When you want to control the flavor of a dish with its other ingredients and just add pure heat, this is ideal.  The bottle has a dropper attached to the lid, so it is easy to meter out just the right amount.  Although the price seems a bit high for such a small bottle, it really is a good deal since it only takes a small amount to add a lot of heat.\",\n",
       "  'Adds flavor and heat to food. Hot, but not intolerable for those who can handle spicy foods. Purchased as a gift and would buy again.',\n",
       "  \"This is one hot extract.  I use 1 drop in a bowl of soup and it makes it plenty hot.  I also use it to heat up my chili.  If you like it hot, but not so over the top you can't taste the food, then this is the Final Answer you've been looking for.\",\n",
       "  'Aside from the obvious benefits of using this product to spice up your food, it also works wonders with multiple other \"regular\" household problems.  Rusted bolts don\\'t stand a chance against the metal disintegrating power of this product, it works better and faster then WD-40.  It also does wonders for pest control as I had a few ants constantly in my garage so I put this stuff in a dish with some syrup in the middle.  All the ants died crossing this sauce.  I also successfully removed a small grease stain from my garage floor, which isn\\'t as practical as it is possible because you have to use a majority of the hot sauce.<br /><br />The sauce itself is unbelievably hot.  I\\'m talking pain inducing I\\'m too sick to move spicey.  I put a squirt on a chip and thought my nose started bleeding.  I\\'d recommend you only use this product in LARGE batches of food (large pot of chili).  If you want to experience about as much pain as possible without any long term effects (at least I hope not) take a swig of this stuff.  I\\'d also recommend a comfortable toilet seat and possibly a magazine subscription and some kleenex if you start crying.  Amazon really knows what to sell if they are trying to increase product sales in other departments.',\n",
       "  \"I really liked this hot sauce, it is incredibly hot. It's perfect for pranking friends with, if you're looking for something like that. My only complaint is that it's a bit hard when cooking with it to find a good balance of the hot and flavor. Other than that, the heat and flavor are both there and are almost perfect!\",\n",
       "  \"This stuff is pretty dang hot.  It doesn't have the best flavor, but that is understandable for sauce that comes with a dropper.  Best used for spicing up a pot of beans and rice or chili.  So if you want to try this stuff on a chip or something you better have a half hour or so to deal with the burn...its intense!\",\n",
       "  'The bottle is tiny but it will go a long way!  All you need is a tiny drop on a toothpick to spice up your plate.',\n",
       "  \"This is just one for the shelf. It looks pretty interesting if you hold a flashlight to it. But, the fact it is not an actual EXTRACT and has other ingredients (habanero's being the first) is why I put this one off for years before finally ordering. THE SOURCE from Original Juan (same company that produces this) @ 7.1 million scovilles is a much better purchase. BUY TWO! One bottle of The Source will last a life. Better yet, grab a 1 mL. vial of 16 MILLION scoville capsaicin crystal from [...]\",\n",
       "  \"I bought this sauce with very high expectations for heat. I was disappointed. I know something is wrong, this is supposed to be very very spicy, but when I tried it... it wasn't too bad at all. I got a bad batch or something. The taste is pretty bad, it's really earthy... dirt flavor. But I wasn't expecting good taste, just heat, which didn't deliver very well. I kept this at a high rating because it's really spicy, but I just got a bad batch.\",\n",
       "  \"I love the litter dropper in the lid to add just the right number of drops. It is spicy, but not too bad. For some fun try adding 4-5 drops in your next batch of brownies. It's actually really good.\",\n",
       "  'The dark chocolates were great and the packaging was great for Christmas<br />The tin was something you dont see in America anymore.<br />Perfect to reuse for candy or other things at christmas.',\n",

       "  \"A friend introduced me to Lavazza a few years ago, and I have to say it's one of the nicest coffees I've had. I use it in my stove top espresso maker, and it brews a perfect cup every time. I also use the decaf version, which is also really good for decaf. My only gripe would be that it's neither fair trade or organic.\",\n",
       "  'This espresso coffee is an excellent coffee.  It has a wonderful head on it and a great flavor.  I only wish it were a little stronger.  It is a mellow espresso flavor and I prefer bold rich flavors to my espresso coffee.  My wife who likes a milder coffee thinks that this is the best espresso she has ever had!',\n",

       "  \"My daughter, living and working in DC this summer, introduced me to this product while home for a visit.  She encouraged me to give the plain version (just pure coconut water) a chance first, and by the second container, I understood the amazing qualities of this drink.  I felt so refreshed, hydrated, and healthy!  I later tried the kind with pineapple, which is also delicious, but I think the plain is more effective and purely refreshing when really hot, tired and thirsty, while the sweeter fruit infused version will be amazing as part of a cocktail.  Can't wait for 5:00!\",\n",
       "  \"This has been my favorite brand of coconut water of the ones I've tried. They use real fruit juice for flavoring, as well as it tastes good.<br /><br />We tried the smaller size, and they just aren't large enough to get enough water at the gym, and are not resealable.<br /><br />Things I like about this:<br /><br />* Perfect size for an hour long gym routine<br />* Resealable cap(smaller one lacks this)<br />* Tasty (Like a pina colada)<br /><br />Negative<br /><br />* Box makes it hard to get the last drops- usually end up squishing it up to get the last bit<br /><br />So great coconut water, perfect size, and cheaper than buying locally at sprouts with the Amazon's 'subscribe and save'!\",\n",
